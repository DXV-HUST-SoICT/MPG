\chapter{Managing memory}
\label{chap:p:memory}

This chapter provides an overview of memory management for
propagators. In fact, the memory management aspects discussed
here are also valid for branchers (\autoref{part:b}) and to some
extent even for variables (\autoref{part:v}).

\paragraph{Overview.}

\mbox{}\autoref{sec:p:memory:areas} describes the different
memory areas available in Gecode together with their allocation
policies. The following section (\autoref{sec:p:memory:state})
discusses how a propagator can efficiently manage its own state.
\autoref{sec:p:memory:shared} discusses an abstraction for
sharing data structures among all spaces for one thread, whereas
\autoref{sec:p:memory:local} discusses an abstraction for sharing
data structures among several propagators that belong to the same
space.


\section{Memory areas}
\label{sec:p:memory:areas}

Gecode manages several different memory areas with different
allocation policies: \emph{spaces} provide access to space-allocated
memory, \emph{regions} provide access to temporary memory with implicit
deallocation, and \emph{space-allocated freelists} provide efficient
access to small chunks of memory which require frequent
allocation and deallocation. 

All memory areas but freelists provide operations \?alloc()?,
\?realloc()?, and \?free()? for allocation, reallocation, and
deallocation of memory from the respective area. To provide a
uniform interface, Gecode also defines a \?heap? object (see
\gecoderef[group]{FuncMemHeap}) implementing the very same
allocation functions. All memory-management related operations
are documented in \gecoderef[group]{FuncMem}.

\paragraph{Memory management functions.} 

Let us consider allocation from the \?heap? as an example. By
\begin{code}
int* i = heap.alloc<int>(n);
\end{code}
a memory chunk for \?n? integers is allocated. Likewise, by
\begin{code}
heap.free<int>(i,n);
\end{code}
the memory is freed (for \?heap?, the memory is returned
to the operating system). By
\begin{code}
int* j = heap.realloc<int>(i,n,m);
\end{code}
a memory chunk is allocated for \?m? integers. If possible, \?j?
will refer to the same memory chunk as \?i? (but there is no
guarantee, of course). 

The memory management functions implement \CPP{} semantics:
\?alloc()? calls the default constructor for each element
allocated; \?realloc()? calls the destructor, default
constructor, or copy constructor (depending on whether the
memory area must shrink or grow); \?free()? calls the destructor
for each element freed.

\paragraph{Space.}

Space-allocated memory (see \gecoderef[group]{FuncMemSpace}) is
managed per each individual space. All space-allocated memory is
returned to the operating system if a space is deleted. Freeing
memory (via the \?free()? operation) enables the memory to be
reused by later \?alloc()? operations.

Spaces manage several blocks of memory allocated from the
operating system, the block sizes are automatically chosen based
on the recent memory allocations of a space (and, if a space has
been created by cloning, the memory allocation history of the
original space). The exact policies can be configured, see the
namespace \gecoderef[namespace]{MemoryConfig}.

Memory chunks allocated from the operating system for spaces are
cached among all spaces for a single thread.  This cache for the
current thread can be flushed by invoking the \?flush()?  member
function of \gecoderef[class]{Space}.

Variable implementations, propagators, branchers, view arrays,
for example, are allocated from their \?home? space. An
important characteristic is that all these data structures have
fixed size throughout their lifetimes or even shrink. As
space-allocated memory is managed for later reusal if it is
freed, frequent allocation/reallocation/deallocation leads to
highly fragmented memory with little chance of reusal. Hence,
space-allocated memory is \emph{absolutely unsuited} for data
structures that require frequent allocation/deallocation and/or
resizing. For these data structures it is better to use the heap
or freelists, if possible. See \autoref{sec:p:memory:state} for
more information.

Note that space-allocated memory is available with allocators
compatible with the \CPP{} STL, see
\gecoderef[group]{FuncMemAllocator}.

\paragraph{Region.}
\label{par:p:memory:region}

All spaces for one thread share a chunk of memory for temporary
data structures with very efficient allocation and deallocation
(again, its exact size is defined in the namespace
\gecoderef[namespace]{MemoryConfig}). Assume that \?home? refers
to a space (say, during the execution of the \?propagate()?
function of a propagator), then
\begin{code}
Region r(home);
\end{code}
creates a new region \?r? for memory management (see
\gecoderef[group]{FuncMemRegion}). A region does not impose any
size limit on the memory blocks allocated from it. If necessary,
a region transparently falls back to heap-allocated memory.

\begin{samepage}
  Several regions for the same space can exist simultaneously.
  For example,
\begin{code}
Region r1(home);
int* i = r1.alloc<int>(n);
{ 
  Region r2(home);
  int* j = r2.alloc<int>(m);
  ...
}
\end{code}
\end{samepage}
However, it is essential that regions are used in a stack
fashion: while region \?r2? is in use, no allocation from any
previous region (\?r1? in our example) is allowed. That is, the
following code will result in a crash (if we are lucky):
\begin{code}
Region r1(home), r2(home);
int* j = r2.alloc<int>(m);
int* i = r1.alloc<int>(n);
\end{code}

The speciality of a region is that it does not require \?free()?
operations. If a region is destructed, all memory allocated from
it is freed (unless several regions for the same space exist). If
several regions for the same space are in use, the memory is
entirely freed when all regions are destructed.

Even though a region does not require \?free()? operations, it
can profit from it: if the memory allocated last is freed first,
the freed memory becomes immediately available for future
allocation.

\tip{Keep the scope of a region small}{
In order to make best use of the memory provided by a region it
is good practice to keep the scope of regions as small as
possible. For example, suppose that in the following example
\begin{code}
Region r(home);
{
  int* i = r.alloc<int>(n);
  ...
}
{ 
  int* i = r.alloc<int>(n);
  ...
}
\end{code}
the memory allocated for \?i? is not used outside the two
blocks. Then it is in fact better to rewrite the code to:
\begin{code}
{
  Region r(home);
  int* i = r.alloc<int>(n);
  ...
}
{ 
  Region r(home);
  int* i = r.alloc<int>(n);
  ...
}
\end{code}
Then both blocks will have access to the full memory of the
region. Furthermore, the creation of a region is very efficient
and the code might even benefit from better cache behavior.
}

\paragraph{Heap.}

The \?heap? (a global variable, see
\gecoderef[group]{FuncMemHeap}) is nothing but a \CPP-wrapper
around \?malloc()? and \?free()? as provided by the underlying
operating system. In case memory is exhausted, an exception of
type \gecoderef[class]{MemoryExhausted} is thrown.


\paragraph{Space-allocated freelists.}

Freelists are allocated from space memory. Any object to be
managed by a freelist must inherit from the class
\gecoderef[class]{FreeList} which already defines a pointer to a
next freelist element. The sizes for freelist objects are quite
constrained, check the values \?fl_size_min? and \?fl_size_max?
as defined in the namespace \gecoderef[namespace]{MemoryConfig}.

Allocation and deallocation is available through the member
functions \?fl_alloc()? and \?fl_dispose()? of the class
\gecoderef[class]{Space}.


\section{Managing propagator state}
\label{sec:p:memory:state}

Many propagators require sophisticated data structures to
perform propagation. The data structures are typically kept
between successive executions of a propagator.  There are two
main issues for these data structures: \emph{where} to allocate
them and \emph{when} to allocate them.

\paragraph{Where to allocate.}

Typically, the data structures used by a propagator are of
dynamic size and hence cannot be stored in a simple member of the
propagator.  This means that the propagator is free to allocate
the memory from either its own space or from the heap. Allocation
from the heap could also mean to use other operations to allocate
and free memory, such as \?malloc()? and \?free()? provided by
the operating system or \?new? and \?delete? provided by \CPP.

In case the data structure does not change its size often, it is
best to allocate from a space: allocation is more efficient and
deallocation is automatic when the space is deleted.

In case the data structure requires frequent reallocation
operations, it is better to allocate from the heap. Then, the
memory will not be automatically freed when a space is deleted.
The memory must be freed by the propagator's \?dispose()?
function. Furthermore, the Gecode kernel must be informed that
the \?dispose()? function must be called when the propagator's home
space is deleted, see \autoref{sec:p:started:waive}.

\paragraph{Reporting allocated memory.}

A propagator that has allocated non-space memory must implement
the virtual member function \?allocated()? that returns the
amount (as a value of type \?size_t?) of non-space memory
allocated by the propagator. The function \?allocated()? is used
by the function \?allocated()? for a space to compute the total
amount of memory allocated by a space. Note that only propagators
are considered that have registered for disposal with a space
(only these propagators can have non-space memory allocated anyway).


\paragraph{When to allocate.}

An important fact on which search engines in Gecode rely (see
\autoref{part:s}) is that they always store a space created by
cloning for backtracking and never a space that has already been
used for propagation. The reason is that in order to perform
propagation, the propagators, variables, and branchers might
require some additional memory. Hence, a space that has performed
propagation is likely to require more memory
than a pristine clone. As the spaces stored by a search engine
define the total amount of memory allocated for solving a problem
with Gecode, it pays to save memory by storing pristine clones.

The most obvious policy is to allocate \emph{eagerly}: the data
structures are allocated when the propagator is created and they
are copied exactly when the propagator is copied.

However, very often it is better to \emph{lazily} recompute the
data structures as follows. The data structures are initialized
and allocated the first time a propagator is executed. Likewise,
the data structures are not copied and construction is again
postponed until the propagator is executed again.  Creating and
allocating data structures lazily is often as simple as creating
them eagerly. The benefit is that clones of spaces on which no
propagation has been performed yet require considerably less
memory.

Most propagators in Gecode that require involved data structures
construct their data structures lazily (for example, the
propagator for domain consistent \?distinct? using the algorithm
from~\cite{Regin94}, see
\gecoderef[class]{Int::Distinct::Dom}). Some use a hybrid
approach where some data structures are created eagerly
and others lazily (for example the propagator for \?extensional?
for finite automata using the algorithm
from~\cite{Pesant:CP:2004}, see
\gecoderef[class]{Int::Extensional::LayeredGraph}).



\section{Shared objects and handles}
\label{sec:p:memory:shared}

A common request for managing a data structure (we will refer to
data structure here just as object) is that it is used and shared
by several propagators from different spaces with the restriction
that all spaces are used by a single thread. Gecode provides
\emph{shared objects} and \emph{shared handles} for this form of
sharing. Shared handles and objects are used to implement proper
data structures as introduced in \autoref{sec:m:integer:proper}.

A shared object is heap-allocated and is referred to by several
shared handles. If the last shared handle is deleted, also the
shared object is deleted (implemented by reference counting). In
addition, shared handles provide an \?update()? function that
creates a new copy of the shared object in case the copy is to be
used by a different thread (that is, the Boolean \?share?
argument is true).

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{shared object and handle}
\caption{A simple shared object and handle}
\label{fig:p:memory:shared}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:p:memory:shared} shows a simple example of a shared
object and the shared handle using the object. A shared object
\?SIO? (for \?S?hared \?I?nteger \?O?bject) stores a single
integer \?data? to be shared (normally, this will be an
interesting data structure). A shared object must inherit from
\gecoderef[class]{SharedHandle::Object} and must implement a
virtual \?copy()? function that returns a new shared object. If
needed, a virtual destructor can be defined.

The shared handle \?SI? (for \?S?hared \?I?nteger) is the only
class that has access to a shared object of type \?SIO?. A shared
handle must inherit from \gecoderef[class]{SharedHandle} and can
use the \?object()?  member function to access and update its
shared object.

\begin{samepage}
The most interesting members of \?SI? that are inherited are the
following:
\insertlitcode{shared object and handle:some inherited members}
\end{samepage}

Other inherited members include a copy constructor and an
assignment operator.

Shared integer arrays are an example for shared objects, see 
\autoref{tip:m:integer:sharedelement}.

\section{Local objects and handles}
\label{sec:p:memory:local}

For some applications, it is necessary to share data structures
between different propagators (and/or branchers, see
\autoref{part:b}) that belong to the same space. For example,
several scheduling propagators might record precedences between
tasks in a shared data structure. \emph{Local objects} and
\emph{local handles} implement this form of sharing.

A local object is space-allocated and is referred to by several
local handles. A local object is deleted when its \?home? space
is deleted. Local handles provide an \?update()? function that
creates a new copy of the local object when the space is cloned
(while maintaining the sharing of local objects within a space).

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{local object and handle}
\caption{A simple local object and handle}
\label{fig:p:memory:local}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:p:memory:local} shows a simple local object and
handle. Similar to the shared integer objects from
\autoref{fig:p:memory:shared}, the local integer objects here
provide shared access to a single integer. However, this integer
object is copied whenever the space is copied, so changes to the
object are kept within the same space.

\begin{figure}
\insertlitcode{local object with external resources}
\caption{A local object and handle with external resources}
\label{fig:p:memory:local_res}
\end{figure}

If a local object additionally allocates external resources or
non-space allocated memory, it must inform its \?home? space
about this fact, very much like propagators (see
\autoref{sec:p:started:waive}). \autoref{fig:p:memory:local_res}
shows a local object and handle that implement an array of
integers. In the constructor and the \?dispose? function, the
local object registers and de-registers itself for disposal using
\?AP_DISPOSE?.
